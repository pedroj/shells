# Generative art and shells

These are my first explorations into generative art. Most of them are `R`or `javscript`code files, compiled using either `RStudio`, `python` or `Processing`. 

For years I've been doing figures and illustrations for scientific papers and now I realize that many of these subjects are really art pieces. They convey a message of knowledge, understanding and beauty in a fascinating mix that I'd like to transmit. 

This is my main motivation to keep working on this project. And the first try I made was with shells. Please have a look here: [https://pedroj.github.io/shells](https://pedroj.github.io/shells).
